* there's a limit in querying in Analytics that only accept 3 level of querying e.g `data source -> query table 1 -> query table 2 -> chart 1`
more than that you can't save your works. it's apprently a countermeasure for a bug that dated back to 10 years ago. 
* Sync in Analytics only do add and update existing data. so if the record is deleted in source, the data in zoho analytics is left untouched. Full fetch however, scraping existing data and re-fetch all data from source
